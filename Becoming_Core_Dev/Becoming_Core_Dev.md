NEO operates as an open-source project. Developers who are interested in contributing to core NEO projects are welcomed and encouraged. Anyone can make contributions, ranging from GitHub issues, documentations to providing new features and patches. Those who have given consistent, high quality contributions to development be offered to become a Core Developer. 

## Criteria

### Projects to Contribute

#### 1) GitHub Repositories

For GitHub repositories, please fork, fix, commit and send a Pull Request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. Before sending a Pull Request, please consult the [**Contribution Guideline**](https://github.com/neo-project/neo#how-to-contribute) found on the NEO core project. 

- NEO Core Project

  > *NEO's core project, VM, compilers, nodes and development packs.*

  - [neo](https://github.com/neo-project/neo)
  - [neo-vm](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm)
  - [neo-compiler](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler)
  - [neo-cli](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli)
  - [neo-gui](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-gui)
  - [neo-devpack-dotnet](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-dotnet)


#### 2) Vulnerability Bounty Program 

NEO rewards those who can locate vulnerabilities within the blockchain. For more detail, please follow the [program article](https://neo.org/dev/bounty) and send your findings via email to [erik@neo.org](mailto:erik@neo.org). 

### Qualifying as a Core Developer

Typically, an existing NEO developer will offer you the chance to become a core developer if you have demonstrated that: 

(1) you are interested in the project and are able to contribute

(2) you can dedicate time to maintaining the repositories in the forms of tracking its progress and communicating effectively with other core developers. 

**If**, for example, for a repository in the NEO core project: 

- You have, over the last 3 months, made over 5 pull requests that have been committed to the project OR have edited(added and deleted) over 200 lines of code [*(number determined by referencing /neo-project commits)*](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/graphs/contributors). Or over a longer period of time, made a similar amount of contribution on average. 
- You have been able to consistently make pull requests that do not require extensive reviews and re-writes before being able to commit to the project. 

Then you are likely going to be offered the role of a core developer, which comes with privileges and responsibilities. 

> *Please note that these criteria are **not** hard and fast rules for qualifying as a core developer, but only an example of the work expected from one. The actual criteria will vary in each case. Developers who would like to be considered for a core developer are advised to get in touch with the existing maintainers and core developers through email, GitHub and [Discord](https://discord.io/neo)*



## Privileges

As you become a core developer, you gain access to a few things that you should note: 

#### Commit Privileges

You will be added on the corresponding GitHub repository as a `collaborator`. This means that you are granted `commit` privileges to the repositories of the project. You will also be able to approve or reject all Pull Requests to this repository. 

#### Monitoring Merges

Core developers are able to approve or reject changes to the repository, they are also able to request that even already merged changes be escalated to NEO developers for further discussion, and potentially even be reverted prior to release.

#### Issue Tracker

You would be able to manage the `issues` tab on the GitHub repository, including opening and closing issues, and assigning issues to different categories and closing them. 



## Responsibilities 

As core developers of the NEO core project, there is a shared responsibility to collaborate constructively with other core developers and contributors. That includes the following: 

- You should maintain [effective communication](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#communicating-effectively) and be prompt in responding to questions, including processing issues on GitHub. 
- As you first become a core developer, you should inform the core developers responsible for the same repository as to what areas you are inclined to contribute. This allows the relevant topics and issues to be redirected to you. 
- You are responsible for handling the consequences of accepting/committing a change into the code base. This mostly includes reverting or fixing the commit if it causes any problems for the project. 


- You are responsible for for tracking the `issues` tab of the project you are contributing to. The core developer should reply to issues assigned to them, and decide when issues listed or changes proposed should be escalated for discussion with NEO developers. 


The scope of some of the responsibilities above may vary according to the area you may choose to contribute. 




## Incentivization

A core developer receives monetary rewards from NEO Foundation. Core developers who make continued contributions in the future will be granted core developer rewards on a regular basis. 

*However, it is worth noting that community contributors who become 'core developers' do not become employees of NEO. The goal is to encourage and cultivate the interest in learning about and contributing to the fundamental levels of NEO's development.*



## Core Developer List

A new list of core developers will be compiled each year. Contributors who qualify as core developers in the previous year may become core developers again through the same criteria.
